Question 6:

'When I come around....'

I would definitly say I'm a music buff with very ecletic taste!
Do you remember the first album you bought? I do!

I played it on a (infinity!) loop and never got bored. It was one of the albums on the soundtrack to my youth!
The name of the band is Green Day. What is the name of the album?
