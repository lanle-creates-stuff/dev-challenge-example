Question 7:

'Food glorious food'

I LOVE food! I mean, who doesn't? But I would really consider myself to be a real foodie!
When I'm not in front of a screen coding away I love going to the theatre to see to a good musical!

This particular one is my absolute favourite. I've seen it countless times in different countries too.

Set in New York City, the storyline is loosely based on Giacomo Puccini's La Boh√®me

What's its name?
